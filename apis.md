description: The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known
  as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), is a federal agency within the
  United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that administers the
  Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid,

  the administrative simplification standards from the Health Insurance Portability
  and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), quality standards in long-term care facilities
